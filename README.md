# Credit-Risk-Default-Prediction

## Inspiration
Americans total credit card balance is $986 billion in Q4 of 2022
Average American has $2948 credit card debt
The delinquency rate for Q4 2022 is 2.25%
So itâ€™s a whopping $22.17 billion in a single quarter!! 
Our machine learning model helps for companies to perform better and lessen the dent in economy.

## What it does
To improve our profitability and mitigate credit risk of companies through the power of predictive systems.

## How we built it
We built it using American express dataset, which contains 5.5 million records with 458k unique customer's 12 month data, aggregated features by median and ran both xgboost and neural network models to predict the probability of a customer

## Challenges we ran into
The dataset was pretty huge, so we loaded into chunks, and the training time for both the algorithms was pretty high.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The model accurately predicts the probability of a customer defaulting by 92% and we have significantly reduced the training times of the model by 40x

## What we learned
That data processing and cleaning is pretty hectic task. Also for every machine learning solution there needs to be a business strategy associated with it. We are proud to create a business strategy for a company which improves their revenue and reduces the default rate.

## What's next for Credit Risk Default Prediction
We can improve the accuracies further by hyper parameter optimization.
